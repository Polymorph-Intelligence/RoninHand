The RoninHand is an open-source, tendon-driven dexterous hand. It leverages a semi print-in-place (PIP) design that consolidates the core structure into just three 3D-printed parts to streamline assembly. The design is engineered to use common, off-the-shelf hardware, making it a practical platform for makers, researchers, and hobbyists.

## Design and Capabilities

*   **Degrees of Freedom:** 20 total (15 active).
*   **Onboard Actuation:** The palm houses 12 Feetech SCS0009 servos for primary motion.
*   **Current Configuration:** Finger abduction/adduction (side-to-side motion) is mechanically locked in the hand-only version. The system is designed for future integration with a forearm that will house the remaining actuators.

## Printed Parts & Assembly

The core structure consists of 3 main 3D-printed parts:

1.  **The Dorsal Assembly:** Includes the four fingers and the back of the hand, all printed as a single articulated piece.
2.  **The Palmar Assembly:** Includes the thumb and the palm. This part has an opening to insert servos and connect the tendons to the servo horns.
3.  **The Cover:** Snaps onto the palmar assembly to cover the opening, requiring no fasteners.
